# Test Assignment for Frontend Developer

## Part1: Theoretical Questions

### 1. VUE3.js: Describe the advantages of using Vue.js compared to other JavaScript frameworks like React.

1. Vue.js offers well-structured official documentation.
2. Vue is a relatively lightweight framework which means it has a smaller bundle size compared to some other frameworks
   like React.
3. Vue.js leverages a reactive data binding system, which means that changes to the data automatically update the
   corresponding parts of the UI. This reactivity reduces the need for manual DOM manipulation and makes the development
   process more efficient.
4. Template system of React is always JSX. In Vue, there is more flexibility like HTML/JavaScript/Typescript/JSX. Since
   Vue3, they added also the possibilities to define custom elements like Web Components.

**FUN FACT**: React is a library.

### 2. Typescript: Explain how Typescript differs from regular JavaScript and how it can contribute to the development of robust applications.

1. Makes the code more readable. You can for example faster see what type of data a function returns, what type a
   certain parameter has to be or what type of variable you deal with. TypeScript allows you also to define custom
   types, interfaces, and enums making your codebase even more self-explanatory.
2. Javascript variable can be any type of value. It even can change types dynamically during runtime. With Typescript it
   is possible to define explicit data types. By setting those types it ensures that variables are used with the
   intended data types and prevent them from being reassigned with incompatible data later in the code.
3. When TypeScript is implemented diligently, following strict type declarations and avoiding the use of the `any` type,
   it significantly enhances type completion capabilities. This will make the developing process more smoothly and more
   enjoyable for the developer.

### 3. Tailwind CSS: What are the benefits of using Tailwind CSS? Provide an example of how you would use it to create a responsive design.

1. Tailwind CSS gives the possibility to build faster custom designed elements and reducing the need for writing custom
   css for every element.
2. Tailwind CSS is designed with responsiveness in mind. It includes utility classes that allow it to adapt the layout
   and styles for different screen sizes.
3. Tailwind CSS is fast to learn and delivers good documentation.
4. Tailwind CSS is not as other UI styling frameworks/libraries pre-styled. It's a utility-first approach where its easy
   to modify to a certain design system.
5. Tailwind CSS is tree shakable, it will optimize the final CSS output, ensuring that only the classes used in your
   project are included in the production build, resulting in minimal file size and faster loading times.
